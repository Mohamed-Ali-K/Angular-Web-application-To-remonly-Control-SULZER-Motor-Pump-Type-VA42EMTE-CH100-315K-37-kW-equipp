# Angular Web application To remonly Control SULZER Motor Pump Type VA42EMTE CH100-315K (37 kW) equipping with an ABB ASC580 R4 AC Driver. Using an ESP32
Remotely controlled a SULZER motor pump Type VA42EMTE CH100-315K (37 kW) equipping with an ABB ASC580 R4 AC Driver. Using an ESP32 microcontroller and a web application

• Technology used:

• The web application: Angular 8, Firebase, Git, Angular Material, Realtime Database

• Some electronic knowledge. Choosing the compounds (resistance, condenser relay...) and welding the components

• C++ to program l’ESP32

Objective:

➢ Starts and stops the remote motor pump through the web application

➢ Increase and decrease the frequency of the moto pump

➢ Know the frequency and current and the Speed in real time

➢ Knowing the sea water level in the basin where motor pump is installed

➢ Stop the motor pump in case of distrust (overheating, motor pump cavitation, etc.)

➢ Notify the operator in a breakdown

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
